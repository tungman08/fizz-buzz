# FizzBuzz with JavaScript and Jest

## Intro

Aim is to revise JavaScript and introduce myself to the Jest testing framework by test driving the FizzBuzz kata.

## What is FizzBuzz?

A small kata which requires the numbers 1 to 100 to be printed, with the following conditions:

1. If the number is divisible by 3, return "Fizz"
2. If the number is divisible by 5, return "Buzz"
3. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, return "Fizzbuzz"
4. Otherwise simply return the number

## Setup

1. Pull repository ```mkdir FizzBuzz-JavaScript-Jest```

2. Enter the newly created directory ```cd fizz-buzz```

3. Install Jest locally within only this directory ```npm install```

4. Run program using: ```npm start```

## Run Practice test

1. Run test using: ```npm run test```
